- Using the extension `Prettier` to format our style
- Imports in the following order: Chakra, React, Assets/utilities, Server-API, Components
- Favour defining variables as `const` instead of `let`
- Specific for server-api
  - Parameter variables will be in snake case
  - Comments explaining what a function does
  - Creation and update functions will have their input variables be in an object
