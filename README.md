# AdventureAudit

## Project Summary and Vision

AdventureAudit is a travel focused expense tracking web application that aims to provide users a quick and easy to use tool to document the transactions of their trips. AdventureAudit can document trip expenses individually or with other travelers as a group.

The main users of AdventureAudit are travelers who want to have a clear record of their spending history. AdventureAudit provides travelers the option to set their budget at the start of a trip to help them not overspend. Transactions and expenses can be quickly added to a trip from flight tickets to accommodations. These transactions can also be given different categories to increase the level of detail of their spending history. Custom categories can be created for a traveler’s specific needs and circumstances. AdventureAudit will produce a comprehensive report of expenses for each trip, listing the top five most expensive purchases and displaying a pie chart organized by transaction category. This report will serve as a tool for the users to analyze their expenses and as a reference for future planning decisions. Traveling abroad? Don’t worry! AdventureAudit will handle transactions made in foreign currencies.

Using AdventureAudit makes it easy to travel with friends and family. Travelers can add their travel partner(s) to their AdventureAudit trip, allowing them all to add transactions to the same trip. Furthermore, AdventureAudit can divide the costs of purchases evenly among the travelers. For example, if one person organizes the hotel or plane tickets for a trip, AdventureAudit can display how much money the other travelers in the group would need to give the organizer.

AdventureAudit lowers the stress of traveling with a budget by creating a simple and fast way to document the spending of your trip. Instead of focusing on your budget, focus on making memories.
